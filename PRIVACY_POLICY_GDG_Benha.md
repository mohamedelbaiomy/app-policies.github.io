# Terms of Service - Privacy Policy

Welcome to **GDG On Campus Benha**, Your gateway to excellence and creativity

The application is designed to manage the team and its events in terms of registering students for events and entering them with the code that appears to each student. The core team also uses it to scan students and at the end of the event it displays all registered students for easy access and complete organization in the event.

##  1. Information Collection

 **`Personal Data`**

When you sign up for a GDG Benha account, we collect email address, and any other information you provide.

We may ask you to confirm your registration information ( your email address ) to continue using the Service. If you choose not to do so, your access to the Service may be restricted or terminated.

After registering, you can upload your personal photo and some personal data such as your phone number and a brief summary about yourself, but you can not upload all this data if you want and it will not affect your use of the application.

As for the camera permissions, they are specific to the core team so that our team can scan people applying to the team’s events, so they are completely unimportant to the applicants. No images taken from the camera are collected to be stored or to train AI models. Once any member of the team scans the event applicant to record their attendance, the camera’s role ends and nothing taken from it is stored.
